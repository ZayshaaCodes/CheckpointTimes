# CP Split Times & Speeds Tracker Plugin for TrackMania

## Overview

The CP Split Times & Speeds Tracker is a rewritten plugin i'd made for myself long ago, it's simple but very nice to have.

## Key Features

- **CP Split Time and Speed Tracking**: Captures and displays information about your performance at each checkpoint, including both time and speed metrics.
- **Ghost Comparison**: Enhance your competitive edge by comparing your current run against the most recently loaded ghost data. This allows for a direct performance comparison, with the ghost appearing as the 'target' in your tracking data. (speed doesnt work unfortunately because it's not stored in the ghost data directly)
- **HUD for Last Split**: A sleek, minimalistic heads-up display (HUD) shows the last split time and speed, so you can see last splits at all times without needing the full UI. After resetting it will retain the last split time and speed too. I always forgot to look before resetting so it's a nice QOL thing :D

## Usage

Upon installation, the plugin seamlessly integrates with your game, tracking CP split times and speeds during your runs. It offers the flexibility to toggle the visibility of both the comprehensive tracking window and the minimalistic last split HUD based on your preferences.

## Save Data

The plugin saves your run data to json files in:

``` %USERPROFILE%\OpenplanetNext\PluginStorage\CheckpointTimes\ ``` 

### Comparing Against Ghosts

To set a ghost as your target for comparison, simply click the eye in the leaderboard. the last set ghost's times will be used

### Future Plans

- **Resets Tracking**: An upcoming feature aimed at RPG and trial map enthusiasts, tracking resets to offer deeper insights into run consistency.
- **Additional Visualizations**: More visual tools for comparing current, personal best, target, and past runs.
- **Server Best CP Times Window (maybe)**: Would display server best CP times much like custom servers.
